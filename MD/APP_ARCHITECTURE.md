### Shared Kernel — `shared/models/`

`lib/shared/models/` is the **domain Shared Kernel** (DDD): pure domain models shared by two or more bounded contexts, owned by NO single feature.

| Model | Consumers |
|---|---|
| `PatientEntity` | `features/auth` (login envelope `LoginResponseEntity.patient`) + `core/database` (`PatientSerializer`) |
| `ClinicalHistoryEntity` + 6 sub-entities | `features/clinical_history` (domain/infrastructure/presentation) + `core/database` (`ClinicalHistorySerializer`) |
| `LabResultEntity` + sub-entities | `features/lab_results` (domain/infrastructure/presentation) + `core/database` (`LabResultsSerializer`) |

**Why they live in `shared/` and not in their owning feature:** `core/database/` persists these models, and `core/` is feature-agnostic (architecture Rule 14: `core/` NEVER imports `features/`). Moving them back to a feature would force `core/` → `features/` imports and break the dependency direction.

**Criteria for adding a model to the Shared Kernel:**
1. The model is consumed by ≥ 2 bounded contexts (features and/or `core/`).
2. It is 100% pure Dart (no Flutter, no third-party types) — enforced by Rule 2/Rule 10.
3. It does NOT depend on `core/`, `app/`, `l10n/`, or any feature.

**Governance of changes:** a change to a Shared Kernel model impacts ALL its consumers. When modifying one, run the full test suite (unit + goldens + integration) and update every affected serializer/mapper/store. The round-trip guard tests `test/core/database/*_serializer_test.dart` protect consistency across boundaries.

**`AppRoute` — shared navigation contract (`shared/router/app_route.dart`):** typed route registry consumed by `app/` (route table + guard) and features (navigation via `IAppNavigator`) and tests. Pure Dart (no go_router), so it complies with Rule 10. It is NOT a persisted model → no serializer round-trip required, but a move/change touches all consumers and must be done in one commit.

> Feature-private entities (e.g. `LoginResponseEntity`, `TokenEntity`) stay in `features/<name>/domain/entities/`. Only genuinely shared models migrate to the Shared Kernel.

---

### Shared transport contracts (`core/network/contracts/`)

Wire DTOs that cross bounded contexts live in `lib/core/network/contracts/` (barrel `_contracts.lib.dart`, re-exported by `core/network/_network.lib.dart`). This is the shared transport-contract module: DTOs here describe API payloads consumed by more than one feature, so they cannot live in a single feature's `infrastructure/dtos/`.

**Criterion**: cross-feature wire contracts → `core/network/contracts/`; feature-exclusive payloads → `features/<name>/infrastructure/dtos/`.

Currently it holds: the clinical-history wire contract (`ClinicalHistoryDto` + 6 sub-DTOs, `ClinicalHistoryListResponseDto`, `ClinicalHistoryMapper`) and `PatientDto` (shared patient wire shape used by the auth login envelope). Both **auth** (login envelope parsing) and **clinical_history** (GET /user/clinical-history) consume it.

> **Guard (Rule 29):** CI fails if a `*.freezed.dart`/`*.g.dart` is left without its sibling `*.dart` source in the same directory. When moving a contract to `core/network/contracts/`, delete the generated files from the source folder (e.g. remnants of a DTO migration).

### Configuration — via providers (DIP)

`AppUries` (implementing `IEndpointConfig`) reads host/port/https from an injected `AppEnvironment`, exposed through `appUriesProvider` (`core/network/api_endpoints.dart`) bound to `environmentProvider`. Remote datasources receive `IEndpointConfig` by constructor (via feature DI) — no static `AppEnvironment.current` reads outside `core/config/` (architecture Rule 16).

### Session data clearing (logout)

`clearSession()` clears the session-scoped data explicitly (token + credentials + registered session stores: patient info, clinical history). Contract: a feature that caches session-scoped data must register its store's clear in `LocalAuthDatasourceImpl.clearSession()`. App-global/device data survives logout; a total database wipe is only done via `IAppDatabase.resetDatabase()` (core primitive, for account reset / GDPR) — a **full wipe** that deletes the DB file **and** the encryption key. The production consumer is `ResetAccountUseCase` (auth) → `LocalAuthDatasourceImpl.resetAccount()` = `clearSession()` (secure storage: token + credentials) **+** `resetDatabase()` (DB file + key) — no orphaned credentials survive the GDPR wipe.

**Lab results cache is deliberately NOT cleared on logout** (`labResultsStore` is not registered in `clearSession()`): its data is session-scoped but write-through-invalidated on every load/refresh, so a stale read is impossible after re-login; the only full wipe is `resetAccount()`. Documented coupling for auth in `features/lab_results/spec/contracts.md`.

### Features

- `features/auth` — authentication (login, session restore, token refresh). Repository split by role (ISP): `IAuthRepository` (login/refreshToken, remote) implemented by `AuthRemoteRepositoryImpl` + `ILocalAuthRepository` (saveSession/clearSession/restoreSession, local) implemented by `AuthLocalRepositoryImpl` — one class = one contract (Rules 19a/19b).

> **Enforced by CI (`test/architecture/dependency_rules_test.dart`):** Rule 18 (usecases depend on other usecases via `IUseCase<Input, Output>`, never concrete classes), Rule 19a (1 contract = 1 impl in `domain/repositories` + `domain/datasources`), Rule 19b (1 class = 1 contract in `infrastructure/`), Rule 20 (providers of `core/database/tables/` only in `*_providers.dart` files).
- `features/clinical_history` — clinical history list (remote `GET /user/clinical-history` via `IClinicalHistoryRemoteDatasource` + offline cache via `IClinicalHistoryLocalDatasource`/`clinicalHistoryStoreProvider`, online-first repository with write-through: cache fallback only on a genuine connectivity failure).
- `features/lab_results` — lab results (remote `GET /user/clinical-history/lab-results` via `ILabResultsRemoteDatasource` + offline cache via `ILabResultsLocalDatasource`/`labResultsStoreProvider`, online-first repository; numeric tests render as trend charts through the `ITrendChart` seam (`trendChartProvider`, wraps `package:fl_chart` — never imported in features), non-numeric tests as a flat list; period filter + pull-to-refresh; navigated to imperatively from the clinical_history AppBar via `IAppNavigator`).

### Bounded contexts — auth ↔ clinical_history (documented coupling)

`LocalAuthDatasourceImpl` (auth context) persists, clears, and reads the `ClinicalHistoryEntity` cache (clinical_history context): the login envelope (`LoginResponseEntity.clinicalHistory`) transports the clinical history and, per online-first, is cached at login — documented responsibility of auth in `features/clinical_history/spec/contracts.md` ("the cache is populated by the auth feature at login").

This is an **intentional and contained** cross-context coupling: the Shared Kernel (`shared/models/`) exists precisely to allow it without `core/` depending on features (Rule 14) or features depending on each other (Rule 5).

**Criteria to re-evaluate (not implementing today):** appearance of an inter-feature event/session bus (auth publishes "session restored"; clinical_history subscribes and caches its own data), or another bounded context needing to write the clinical history cache.

---

### Dependency direction — one-way DI (no `features → app`)

Feature DI (`features/*/di/`) wires domain interfaces to infrastructure impls and imports the providers it needs **directly from `core/`** (never from `app/`). The `app/` layer is the composition root and binds cross-cutting seams:

| Core provider | App binding |
|---|---|
| `authDioProvider` (no interceptor), `httpServiceProvider` (with auth interceptor), `authInterceptorProvider` (seam, fail-fast default) | `app/di/network/dio_overrides.dart` → `dioOverrides()`, merged in `main.dart` |
| `appNavigatorProvider` (seam, fail-fast default) | `app/di/router/router_overrides.dart` → `routerOverrides()`, merged in `main.dart` |

`httpServiceProvider` applies whatever `IAuthInterceptorProvider` the composition root provides, so `core/network` never imports the auth feature. A feature that navigates imperatively uses `IAppNavigator` (imported from its own `di/`, which re-exports the core seam on-demand) — never via `app/` nor `go_router`. Enforced by architecture Rule 11 (`features/` never imports `app/`).

---

### Result / AppError data flow

All fallible operations return `Result<T>` (Success / Failure) via `guard()`.

```
shared/error/ → guard() in result_guard.dart catches Exception/Error → creates Failure(AppError)
datasource  → raw call, no try/catch
repository  → guard(() => datasource.call())                            ← creates Result
usecase     → passes repository Results through unchanged; wraps shared ports (raw values) with guard() ← still a Result boundary
notifier    → result.fold(onFailure: ..., onSuccess: ...)               ← consumes Result
```

> See **MD/APP_DARTZ.md** for the full pattern, code examples and checklist.

### Local datasource layer

If a feature needs offline persistence, add an `ILocal<Feature>Datasource` (e.g. `ILocalAuthDatasource`) in `domain/datasources/` with its implementation in `infrastructure/datasources/`. The repository combines remote + local:

```
repository → guard(() => remoteDs.method())
              guard(() => localDs.storeSession(data))
              guard(() => localDs.restoreSession())
```

### Domain services

Complex domain logic (e.g., session restoration with token expiry checks) lives directly in use cases under `domain/usecases/`, eliminating the need for separate service interfaces and service implementations:

- `RestoreSessionUseCase` in `domain/usecases/` — replaces the session restoration service
- `Handle401UseCase` in `domain/usecases/` — replaces the retry handler service

### ITokenVerifier — interface in shared/interfaces/

The `ITokenVerifier` interface lives in `lib/shared/interfaces/` (not `core/services/auth/`). Its implementation (`JwtTokenExpiryChecker`) remains in `core/services/auth/`. Feature code accesses it via `ref.watch(tokenVerifierProvider)` (imported from `core/services/auth/token_providers.dart`).

`ITokenVerifier` is deliberately **expiry-only** (ISP): it exposes a single `isExpired()` and does NOT decode payloads nor verify signatures. Payload decoding is delegated to `IJwtWrapper.decodePayload()` (`core/services/auth/jwt_wrapper.dart`, via `jwtWrapperProvider`), and signature verification is a server-side concern (the app never verifies JWT signatures locally).

Infrastructure files that import `ITokenVerifier` — such as `local_auth_datasource_impl.dart` — import it from `shared/interfaces/_interfaces.lib.dart` (Rule 26: the folder is only imported through its barrel).

### guard() exception mapping

```
ApiException               → Failure(ApiError(technicalMessage: 'HTTP <code>'))
NoConnectionException      → Failure(NetworkError())
ServerUnreachableException → Failure(ServerUnreachableError())
UnexpectedResponseException→ Failure(UnexpectedError(technicalMessage: details))
AppTimeoutException        → Failure(TimeoutError(technicalMessage: message))
TimeoutException (dart)    → Failure(TimeoutError(technicalMessage: message))
DioException (timeout)     → AppTimeoutException (checked before falling through)
Error                      → RETHROWN (fail-fast — programming errors are NOT swallowed)
```

> Exception `details` are developer-facing technical messages: **English only**, never interpolating a raw error object. User-facing strings are produced by `localizeError()` in `lib/l10n/` (UI layer), never from the exception message.
